# Introduction to Git

Git is a free and open-source version control system that helps developers track changes in their codebase over time. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project by creating a centralized repository of all changes made to the code.

# Benefits of Using Git

1. Version Control: Git keeps a record of all changes made to the code, allowing developers to easily revert to previous versions if needed.
2. Collaboration: Git enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, reducing conflicts and improving productivity.
3. Backup: Git provides a backup of the codebase, ensuring that all changes are safely stored and can be recovered in case of data loss.
4. Branching and Merging: Git's branching and merging features allow developers to work on different features or bug fixes independently, making it easier to manage complex projects.
5. Open-Source: Git is open-source, which means it is free to use and distribute, and its source code is available for modification and customization.s
