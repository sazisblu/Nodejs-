You can run JavaScript code in a Markdown file using Node.js by following these steps:

### Step 1: Create a new JavaScript file

Create a new file with a `.js` extension, for example, `script.js`.

### Step 2: Write your JavaScript code

In the `script.js` file, write your JavaScript code. For example:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

### Step 3: Run the JavaScript code using Node.js

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your `script.js` file is located. Then, run the following command:

```bash
node script.js
```
